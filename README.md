# Generate HTML with Node

## Description
In this project, I made an app which creates an HTML file with Node. After answering all the questions, an HTML document will be automatically generated with all your answers. This project helped me to understand better Node and how you can use it. I also created class and differtent JS files that I have to link to each other with different function. It is my first project with class, Node and linked JS file.
